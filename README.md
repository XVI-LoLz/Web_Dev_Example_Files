# Description

This file structure covers three different languages: **HTML**, **CSS** and **JS** (JavaScript).

Inside each language folder you will find different levels:

- **Basic**
- **Intermediate**

Each level has several _lessons_ that you can follow along using your editor and browser.

To have the best experience we suggest to follow the next workflow.

# Suggested workflow

## Using VS Code as editor

Get the [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) editor and install it.

### Extensions

You can click the following extension links to install them or go to the Extensions side panel inside VS Code to do so.

#### Live Server

To edit the files in real time without too much hassle you can install the [Live Share](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) extension for VS Code.

Once you have it you can open any `.html` file and **right-click** -> **Open with Live Server** to launch your default browser and start editing the code.

#### Markdown Preview Enhanced

Some lessons include an `.md` file that contains a description of the current task. In case you want to preview them in a more visual-friendly format you can add the [Markdown Preview Enhanced](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced) extension to your VS Code editor.

Once you have it you can open any `.md` file and **right-click** -> **Markdown Preview Enhanced: Open preview to the side**

## Getting the files

### For beginners

For beginners we suggest to download the files from the [repo page](https://github.com/XVI-LoLz/Web_Dev_Example_Files) and click **Code** -> **Download Zip**.

You'll get a `.zip` that you can unzip and **open the main folder with VS Code**.

One thing to consider with this approach is that you will have to update the files manually in case new lessons are added to the repo.

### Ideal

For people that know their way around Git/GitHub we suggest to clone the repo.
